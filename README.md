# garden_iot

A new Flutter project for beginners.

## What is this project about?

This project aims to create an Android application for an IoT system to monitor the sensors and actuators.
Users can interface with the system through the app.
To understand the project quickly and easily, I prefer you to take a moment at the getting started section and learn all the basics of flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Here are a few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Design UX/UI for the apps
Here is my design print for the app, it is the first design of my work.

The design pattern MVVP is not included in this project, you can turn this project into some design pattern to practice like provider, riverpod, getXcontroller, or bloc pattern...

## Used purpose
Because this project is basic and good to start learning Flutter, I suggest you clone or download it for your purposes.
